  abstract = {Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning?based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25Åã resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used to predict weather are large, complex, and computationally demanding and do not learn from past weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine learning?based method that has been trained directly from reanalysis data of past atmospheric conditions. In this way, the authors were able to quickly predict hundreds of weather variables globally up to 10 days in advance and at high resolution. Their predictions were more accurate than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of tested cases and displayed better severe event prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. ?H. Jesse Smith Machine learning leads to better, faster, and cheaper weather forecasting.}

Abstract?We present an overview of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), a parallel and efficient algorithm for simulating single-phase and multiphase fluid flows and for incorporating additional physical complexities. The LBM is especially useful for modeling complicated boundary conditions and multiphase interfaces. Recent extensions of this method are described, including simulations of fluid turbulence, suspension flows, and reaction diffusion systems. }

abstract = {Short-term wind speed forecast is of great importance to wind farm regulation and its early warning. Previous studies mainly focused on the prediction at a single location but few extended the task to 2-D wind plane. In this study, a novel deep learning model was proposed for a 2-D regional wind speed forecast, using the combination of the auto-encoder of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory unit (LSTM). The 12-hidden-layer deep CNN was adopted to encode the high dimensional 2-D input into the embedding vector and inversely, to decode such latent representation after it was predicted by the LSTM module based on historical data. The model performance was compared with parallel models under different criteria, including MAE, RMSE and R2, all showing stable and considerable enhancements. For instance, the overall MAE value dropped to 0.35?m/s for the current model, which is 32.7%, 28.8% and 18.9% away from the prediction results using the persistence, basic ANN and LSTM model. Moreover, comprehensive discussions were provided from both temporal and spatial views of analysis, revealing that the current model can not only offer an accurate wind speed forecast along timeline (R2 equals to 0.981), but also give a distinct estimation of the spatial wind speed distribution in 2-D wind farm.}

abstract={Parallel computation of the two and three-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the lattice Boltzmann method are presented. BGK type approximation for collision term in 9 velocity square lattice model is used. It is found that the lattice Boltzmann method is able to reproduce the dynamics of decaying turbulence and could be an alternative for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The lattice Boltzmann method is parallelized by using domain decomposition and implemented on a distributed memory computer, Hitachi SR2201. It is found that vertical decomposition gives the highest speedup. In the case of horizontal decomposition the longer the number of lattice units in horizontal direction of each subdomain, the shorter the CPU time. Extension to three-dimension is carried out using 15 velocity cubic lattice model. Compared with the result of two-dimensional case, a higher speedup is obtained than in the three-dimensional simulation. Further investigation is needed on the accuracy and efficiency of cubic lattice BGK model.},
