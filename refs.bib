  abstract = {Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning?based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used to predict weather are large, complex, and computationally demanding and do not learn from past weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine learning?based method that has been trained directly from reanalysis data of past atmospheric conditions. In this way, the authors were able to quickly predict hundreds of weather variables globally up to 10 days in advance and at high resolution. Their predictions were more accurate than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of tested cases and displayed better severe event prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. ?H.

abstract = {Short-term wind speed forecast is of great importance to wind farm regulation and its early warning. Previous studies mainly focused on the prediction at a single location but few extended the task to 2-D wind plane. In this study, a novel deep learning model was proposed for a 2-D regional wind speed forecast, using the combination of the auto-encoder of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory unit (LSTM). The 12-hidden-layer deep CNN was adopted to encode the high dimensional 2-D input into the embedding vector and inversely, to decode such latent representation after it was predicted by the LSTM module based on historical data. The model performance was compared with parallel models under different criteria, including MAE, RMSE and R2, all showing stable and considerable enhancements. For instance, the overall MAE value dropped to 0.35?m/s for the current model, which is 32.7%, 28.8% and 18.9% away from the prediction results using the persistence, basic ANN and LSTM model. Moreover, comprehensive discussions were provided from both temporal and spatial views of analysis, revealing that the current model can not only offer an accurate wind speed forecast along timeline (R2 equals to 0.981), but also give a distinct estimation of the spatial wind speed distribution in 2-D wind farm.}

In the case of horizontal decomposition the longer the number of lattice units in horizontal direction of each subdomain, the shorter the CPU time. Extension to three-dimension is carried out using 15 velocity cubic lattice model.

Flow can be experimentally visualized using, for example, smoke or contrast agents, but extracting velocity and pressure fields from this information is tricky. Raissi et al. developed a machine-learning approach to tackle this problem. Their method exploits the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the dynamics of fluid flow in many scientifically relevant situations. The authors illustrate their approach using examples such as blood flow in an aneurysm. Science, this issue p. 1026 A machine learning approach exploiting the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations can extract detailed fluid flow information. For centuries, flow visualization has been the art of making fluid motion visible in physical and biological systems. Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.}

ABSTRACT = {Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) refers to the emerging area of extracting physically relevant solutions to complex multiscale modeling problems lacking sufficient quantity and veracity of data with learning models informed by physically relevant prior information. This work discusses the recent critical advancements in the PIML domain. Novel methods and applications of domain decomposition in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in particular are highlighted. Additionally, we explore recent works toward utilizing neural operator learning to intuit relationships in physics systems traditionally modeled by sets of complex governing equations and solved with expensive differentiation techniques. Finally, expansive applications of traditional physics-informed machine learning and potential limitations are discussed. In addition to summarizing recent work, we propose a novel taxonomic structure to catalog physics-informed machine learning based on how the physics-information is derived and injected into the machine learning process. The taxonomy assumes the explicit objectives of facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration in methodology, thereby promoting a wider characterization of what types of physics problems are served by the physics-informed learning machines and assisting in identifying suitable targets for future work. To summarize, the major twofold goal of this work is to summarize recent advancements and introduce a taxonomic catalog for applications of physics-informed machine learning.},

This review article offers a perspective on the basic concepts of CNN and its application to various radiological tasks, and discusses its challenges and future directions in the field of radiology. Two challenges in applying CNN to radiological tasks, small dataset and overfitting, will also be covered in this article, as well as techniques to minimize them.

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "auto-diff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational uid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

year = {2015},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},
